## Overview

Chromium is a Snakemake workflow to process 3' single cell RNA sequencing data from the 10x Genomics platform. It is compatible with 10xv2 and 10xv3 chemistry and features three different quantification methods to obtain both spliced and unspliced abundance estimates:

## Installation

Chromium and all of its dependencies can be installed via the [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) package manager:

1. Install Snakemake and Snakedeploy

   ```console
   $ mamba create -c bioconda -c conda-forge --name snakemake snakemake snakedeploy
   ```

2. Activate the Snakemake environment

   ```console
   $ mamba activate snakemake
   ```

3. Create a project directory

   ```console
   $ mkdir -p path/to/project
   ```

4. Deploy the workflow in the project directory

   ```console
   $ snakedeploy deploy-workflow https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/chromium path/to/project
   ```

## Usage

Chromium is typically executed




1. Create workflow configuration

   ```console
   $ vim config/config.yaml   # workflow parameters
   ```

2. Create samples table

   ```console
   $ vim config/samples.csv   #Â sample metadata
   ```

3. Create units table

   ```console
   $ vim config/units.csv   # unit metdata
   ```

4. Test configuration by performing a dry-run

   ```console
   $ snakemake -n
   ```

5. Execute workflow and deploy software dependencies

    ```console
    $ snakemake --cores all --use-conda
    ```
